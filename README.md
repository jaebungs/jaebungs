# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jae Park. 

### I am a Front End Developer.
I was a maintance technician fixing automated produciton lines.  
One day I was feeling down and decided to do things that I've always wanted to do (Programming and Writing).  
That is how I started programming journey and I am loving this :relaxed:.
